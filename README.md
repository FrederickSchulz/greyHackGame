# greyHackGame
This is a repository where I store my scripts/resources I created and use in the video game "Grey Hack". Grey hack is a hacking Multiplayer game that indirectly teaches (offensive) security skills.

This repo is mainly for myself to have my scripts externally stored in case another player manages to nuke my (ingame) Computer and I don't have to rewrite all my scripts from scratch.

### Programming Language
Gray hack has its own scripting language called GreyScript. The file ending `.src` is assosiated with GreyScript source files.
